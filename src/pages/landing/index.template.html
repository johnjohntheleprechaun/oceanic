            <h1>The Origins of Oceanic</h1>
            <p>Oceanic started as a little hobby project, made to help me journal better (easier?). I had realized that my method of journaling was essentially me messaging the void, as if I was talking to somebody who wasn't really there. The only problem was that I was doing it in Google Keep, which frankly sucked. The solution? Build my own app! What could possibly be difficult about that, right?</p>
            <p>Turns out, a lot of things. For one, I started making this at a time when my mental health was a steaming pile of crap that was destroying my life. Weirdly, this project helped keep me alive through all that. I always had something to work on. A way to distract myself from, well, myself. Another (totallyyyyy minor) problem was that I'd never done anything like this before. Lucky for me, I love teaching myself stuff! This project has given me soooooo much knowledge since I first started it months ago. Everything from fairly basic CSS to cloud hosting and cryptography.</p>
            <p>I don't remember why, but at some point my old therapist mentioned that maybe I could make this into a sellable product. Even that it could be something she'd recommend to her other patients. I kind of shrugged that idea off at the time, but honestly now I think it's a great idea. I mean, I fucking love working on this app, why not make some money from my efforts and share it with the world? Plus, I've looked at the other options out there and none of them really work for me, which probably means some other people might benefit from my work.</p>
            <p>Alright so if I want to make money, why open source it? Because I fucking love open source, that's why. I think everything should be open. Also, I don't want to become some shitty sellout, making software designed only for profit. I want my stuff to be <em>worth it</em>. Since I'm providing cloud backup and optional journal or notes sharing, I can just charge for that. It's a pretty common practice in open source, actually. The reasoning is that not a lot of people want to go through the effort of deploying their own infrastructure (even though they could), so you can provide a paid option to do it for them, provide support, etc.</p>
            <p>One of my main goals for this project, is to have the paid options be <em>entirely optional</em>. It should work just fine as a local only application. No intrusive ads for the paid service everywhere I can. I hate when companies do that crap. Besides, that would directly go against my other goal, which is to make this as user friendly as possible. Keeping in mind that nobody wants to be distracted while they're journaling, especially if, like me, they often journal when overwhelmed.</p>
