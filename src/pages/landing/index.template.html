                    <h1>Open Security</h1>
                    <p>Oceanic encrypts all your journals before storage, and as an open source project anybody can check the security for themselves. Each document uses it's own key, and every user has their own asymmetric key pair (wrapped with a key derived from your password) to wrap/unwrap each document key. Effectively, this means that you can share a single journal or note, without any risk of somebody being able to decrypt a different one. It also means that even if something horrible happens and your document files are leaked, they won't be usable without your password.</p>

                    <h1>Optional Cloud Backup</h1>
                    <p>With 100% optional cloud backup, you can protect your journals from accidental deletion or data loss. Any documents stored in the cloud are encrypted, just like they are locally. You can also share your documents with other users. Don't have the energy to explain something that happened to your therapist? Just share the journal entry you wrote when it happened, and let them read it themselves! Or suppose you've got a list of movies you liked, and you want to share it with a friend. You can even let them edit it!</p>

            <h1>The Origins of Oceanic</h1>
            <p>Oceanic started as a little hobby project, made to help me journal better (easier?). I had realized that my method of journaling was essentially me messaging the void, as if I was talking to somebody who wasn't really there. The only problem was that I was doing it in Google Keep, which frankly sucked. The solution? Build my own app! What could possibly be difficult about that, right?</p>
            <p>Turns out, a lot of things. For one, I started making this at a time when my mental health was a steaming pile of crap that was destroying my life. Weirdly, this project helped keep me alive through all that. I always had something to work on. A way to distract myself from, well, myself. Another (totallyyyyy minor) problem was that I'd never done anything like this before. Lucky for me, I love teaching myself stuff! This project has given me soooooo much knowledge since I first started it months ago. Everything from fairly basic CSS to cloud hosting and cryptography.</p>
            <p>I don't remember why, but at some point my old therapist mentioned that maybe I could make this into a sellable product. Even that it could be something she'd recommend to her other patients. I kind of shrugged that idea off at the time, but honestly now I think it's a great idea. I mean, I fucking love working on this app, why not make some money from my efforts and share it with the world? Plus, I've looked at the other options out there and none of them really work for me, which probably means some other people might benefit from my work.</p>
            <p>Alright so if I want to make money, why open source it? Because I fucking love open source, that's why. I think everything should be open. Also, I don't want to become some shitty sellout, making software designed only for profit. I want my stuff to be <em>worth it</em>. Since I'm providing cloud backup and optional journal or notes sharing, I can just charge for that. It's a pretty common practice in open source, actually. The reasoning is that not a lot of people want to go through the effort of deploying their own infrastructure (even though they could), so you can provide a paid option to do it for them, provide support, etc.</p>
            <p>One of my main goals for this project, is to have the paid options be <em>entirely optional</em>. It should work just fine as a local only application. No intrusive ads for the paid service everywhere I can. I hate when companies do that crap. Besides, that would directly go against my other goal, which is to make this as user friendly as possible. Keeping in mind that nobody wants to be distracted while they're journaling, especially if, like me, they often journal when overwhelmed.</p>
