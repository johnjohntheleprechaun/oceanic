                <h1>Security</h1>
                <p>Oceanic encrypts all your journals before storage. Each document uses it's own key, and every user has their own asymmetric key pair (wrapped with a key derived from your password) to wrap/unwrap each document key. Effectively, this means that you can share a single journal or note, without any risk of somebody being able to decrypt a different one. It also means that even if something horrible happens and your document files are leaked, they won't be usable without your password.</p>
